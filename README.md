# Pac_Man in CPP.
This is a university assignment. 

## Important infomation

1. This code can only be compiled based on `C++ standard >= 17` because of filesystem being used.

2. Files should be run in the way shown below:
   >There must be a .txt file in the directory of .exe file executed, or else the program won't run as there ain't any level for it to load.
   
   >If you are compiling it from the .cpp code in Visual Studio, you must put the default.txt (level file) into the project directory (Folder with .sln).
   ```
   PacMan (Folder/Project Directory)
   - PacMan.exe
   - default.txt (Which is a text file that stores default level coordinates)
   ```
4. When the exe is being executed, it is **highly advisable** to put the `window in maximise mode` before inputting.
This is to prevent any misaligned printing issues inside the terminal.
