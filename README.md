# Pac_Man in CPP.
This is a university assignment. 
This code can only be compiled based on C++ standard >= 17 because of filesystem being used.

Files should be run in the way shown below:

PacMan (Folder)
  - PacMan.exe
  - default.txt (Which is a text file that stores default level coordinates)

There must be a .txt file in the directory of .exe file executed, or else program won't run as there ain't any level for it to load.
